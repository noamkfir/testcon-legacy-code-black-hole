# Legacy Code Black Hole Overview

This repository tries to emulate the legacy code refactoring/restructuring process.

Each exercise has its own branch.
For example, to switch to the branch for exercise 1: `git checkout exercise-01`.

In addition, each step of each exercise has its own tag.
For example, to switch to the tag for step 3 of exercise 1: `git checkout exercise-01-step-03`.

Every tagged step updates the `README.md` document that you're reading right now.
Just scroll to the end.

You can also see the beginning and end of each exercise by checking out
the tags `exercise-<number>-start` and `exercise-<number>-finish`.

To see the final state of the project, with all the exercises in their final states, check out the tag `finish`.
